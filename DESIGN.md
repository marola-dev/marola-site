# Co2 — Style Reference
> climate atlas in winter light. Build pages as an airy document landscape where serif headlines, category-coded data, and icy image treatments punctuate broad white fields.

**Theme:** light

Source measurements are normalized; roles and recommendations are interpreted. Font summary lists are independent, not paired by position. HTML examples are reconstructions, not source components.

Co2.is frames public climate-policy information as a quiet editorial archive: expansive white space, hairline rules, and low-contrast pill navigation leave room for oversized, whisper-weight serif statements. A near-black editorial ink carries all reading and controls, while pale cyan and mint blocks mark filters and responsible bodies rather than turning the interface into a brightly branded dashboard. Saturated blue, teal, violet, orange, and yellow appear as a compact classification language for climate systems, with a high-contrast blue-and-white environmental image providing the hero’s only large visual interruption.

## marola adaptations

> Source: the Co2 style reference below was obtained from [Refero](https://refero.design/)'s style library. Everything after this section is that reference, unchanged. Where they differ, this section wins.

- **Blue is the primary.** Mint Wash is not used. Selected states (current page, chosen day, pressed toggle, open list) are a Harbor Blue fill with white text; the one primary action on a surface (the chat's open and send buttons) is an Abyss Blue fill.
- **The blue family**, added to the colour tokens:

  | Name | Value | Token | Role |
  |------|-------|-------|------|
  | Abyss Blue | `#0b3d8c` | `--navy` | Serif headings and the wordmark, primary-action fill, the marker rim (10:1 on white) |
  | Harbor Blue | `#1659c0` | `--blue-ink` | Link text, selected-state fill, line icons, the slider (6.5:1 on white) |
  | Climate Blue | `#4098ff` | `--accent` | Hover and focus rings, link underlines, the wordmark's wave, editorial rules; never text (3:1) |
  | Ice Blue | `#eef6ff` | `--ice` | The header band, the footer, hover fills |
  | Cyan Wash | `#dff9ff` | `--cyan` | The empty sea under the map, chat answers |

- **One control.** Every button, select and nav link is the same 36 px pill (32 px under 640 px): 1px Rule Gray border, white fill, 16 px Inter; hover is Ice Blue with a Climate Blue border; selected is Harbor Blue with white text. Segmented groups (day, language) are one outlined pill holding borderless inner pills. A section with no page yet is plain muted text, not a pill.
- **Compact header.** The map is the product: nav pills, then a 38 px serif wordmark (30 px on phones) with a 14 px one-line tagline beside the controls, then the hour bar. No 56–64 px statements on the map page; those stay for about/support.
- **Icons, never emoji.** Line icons in Lucide's style (24 px grid, round caps, 1.75 stroke, Harbor Blue), inline SVG, `aria-hidden`, always followed by their word. Lucide's own shapes where one exists; anything missing (the jellyfish) is drawn in the same style.
- **Beaches are dots.** A beach on the map is a 16 px dot in its score colour with a white ring and an Abyss Blue rim, so a crowded coast reads as points of colour; the selected beach grows to a 32 px badge carrying its score. The five score colours are data and stay as they are; they play the role of the reference's system colour markers.
- **Fonts** are the documented substitutes, self-hosted: Cormorant Garamond for Gt Alpina Standard, Inter for Abacaxilatin(web).

### Layout

## Components

### Global Pill Navigation
**Role:** Top-level page and category navigation

Use Abacaxilatin at 16px / 21.12px, weight 400, in Editorial Ink. Each category item sits in a 999px-radius pill with rgba(186, 186, 186, 0.16) fill; the compact navigation rhythm uses 8px gaps and 10px vertical padding.

### Text Navigation Link
**Role:** Secondary header route

Set in Editorial Ink with the 16px Abacaxilatinweb navigation treatment. Use a quiet #f5f5f5 rounded backing only where a route needs active-state containment; keep the route pair separated by 8px.

### Hero Editorial Heading
**Role:** Opening statement

Use Gt Alpina Standard at 64px, weight 300, 69.12px line-height, in Editorial Ink. Place the statement in a broad white field with large open space below before the image begins.

### Blue Environmental Hero Image
**Role:** Full-width visual break beneath the opening statement

Use a raw-edge, square-cornered photographic or environmental texture treated almost entirely in Climate Blue #4098ff and Paper White #ffffff. Do not place it in a card, add a shadow, or round its corners.

### Editorial Intro Block
**Role:** Section lead and explanatory copy

Pair a 20px Abacaxilatinweb eyebrow at 21.6px line-height with 18px Abacaxilatinweb body copy at 27px line-height, both in Editorial Ink. Separate paragraphs by 32px and let the text occupy a deliberately restrained reading column.

### System Accordion Row
**Role:** Expandable climate-system category

Use a 1px top divider in Rule Gray #d9d9d9, a 26px Abacaxilatinweb label at 39px line-height, and an Editorial Ink plus icon aligned at the far edge. Keep each row on a white surface with 24px vertical spacing; render its superscript-like count at 18px / 27px.

### All-Items Text Link
**Role:** Compact continuation link below an accordion group

Set in Abacaxilatinweb at 14px, weight 500, 27.02px line-height, Editorial Ink, followed by a small right chevron. Do not use a filled container.

### Cyan Institution Chip
**Role:** Responsible-ministry filter or linked label

Use Cyan Wash #dff9ff with Editorial Ink text, 8px radius, and 16px 24px padding. Keep the label in the 18px / 27px Abacaxilatinweb treatment and place chips above or alongside a 1px Rule Gray divider.

### Mint Status Button
**Role:** Implementation-status filter

Use Mint Wash #dbffe7 with Editorial Ink text, 8px radius, and 16px 24px padding. Use this filled treatment for status groups such as progress states; do not reuse it as the universal site action.

### Transparent Outline Pill
**Role:** Inline filter and low-emphasis control

Use a transparent background, 1px solid Editorial Ink border, 999px radius, and horizontal 16px padding. Keep vertical padding at 0px and use compact Abacaxilatinweb text.

### Dark Data Card
**Role:** High-contrast statistical or grouped content module

Use Charcoal Surface #1f232d, 16px radius, no shadow, and 32px padding on every side. Set primary content in Paper White and supporting text in Muted Steel #8b8d90.

### White Data Card
**Role:** Contained informational module

Use Paper White, 16px radius, no shadow, 32px top/right/left padding, and 16px bottom padding. Use Editorial Ink text and Rule Gray dividers where internal rows need separation.

### Large Quiet Panel
**Role:** Grouped background container

Use Soft Canvas #f9f9f9 with a 32px radius and no box shadow. Keep the panel minimally framed; its distinction comes from the surface shift rather than borders or elevation.

### System Color Marker
**Role:** Category identification in charts, labels, and summary blocks

Assign one solid coded surface per system: Community Violet #5077ff, Market Orange #ff7b1b, Land Teal #00b595, or Cross-Action Purple #a545e0. Keep surrounding typography Editorial Ink and avoid gradients.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Paper White #ffffff as the primary canvas and Soft Canvas #f9f9f9 only for quiet grouped regions.
- Set major page statements in Gt Alpina Standard at 64px, weight 300, with 69.12px line-height.
- Use Abacaxilatinweb at 18px / 27px for reading copy and at 16px / 21.12px for navigation.
- Use 1px Rule Gray #d9d9d9 dividers for accordion rows, lists, and quiet structural boundaries.
- Use 999px radius for navigation chips and transparent outline pills; use 8px radius for pale cyan and mint filled controls.
- Keep standard cards at 16px radius with 32px padding and no shadow.
- Reserve #5077ff, #ff7b1b, #00b595, and #a545e0 for climate-system classification rather than general decoration.

### Don't
- Do not use heavy shadows; dark, white, and #f9f9f9 cards have box-shadow: none.
- Do not round environmental imagery; hero visuals use 0px image radius and full-bleed raw edges.
- Do not use Mint Wash #dbffe7 as every page’s default filled action; restrict it to status and implementation filters.
- Do not replace 1px #d9d9d9 rules with thick separators or dark enclosing borders.
- Do not set large display headings in the sans family; use the Gt Alpina Standard 300 treatment for 30px, 38px, and 64px editorial headings.
- Do not add gradients to category surfaces or image overlays.
- Do not compress section rhythm below the 64px section gap or reduce standard card padding below 32px.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Paper White | `#ffffff` | Page canvas, hero, and default reading surface |
| 1 | Soft Canvas | `#f9f9f9` | Quiet large panels and alternate content regions |
| 2 | Washed Gray | `#f5f5f5` | Subtle utility and inactive-control surfaces |
| 3 | Cyan Wash | `#dff9ff` | Highlighted institution labels and cyan content markers |
| 4 | Charcoal Surface | `#1f232d` | High-contrast data-card surface |

## Elevation

Surfaces are separated by paper-white space, #f9f9f9 tonal shifts, 1px #d9d9d9 rules, and 16px or 32px corner geometry. Cards intentionally use no shadow.

## Imagery

Imagery is sparse and atmospheric rather than product-oriented. The main visual is a full-width environmental photograph or textured aerial scene rendered in an aggressively reduced blue-and-white duotone, with grainy water or terrain detail becoming an abstract climate map; it has raw square edges and occupies the full visual width beneath the hero. Icons are monochrome Editorial Ink line marks, including thin plus signs and chevrons. The page is text-dominant: photography functions as a single thematic interruption between editorial text fields rather than a repeated card illustration system.

## Layout

The page is an expansive white editorial document with a compact top navigation bar: a black linked-ring logo at the far left, a small route switch beside it, and category pills aligned across the remaining header. The hero is text-first rather than split: a large left-aligned serif statement occupies a deep white field, followed by a full-width blue-and-white environmental image. Introductory copy returns to a narrow left reading column, while later index sections use a two-column composition with a large serif title at left and a ruled accordion list at right. Sections remain seamless on white rather than alternating dense bands; 64px and larger empty intervals create the rhythm, with pale cyan and mint chips acting as contained functional highlights.
